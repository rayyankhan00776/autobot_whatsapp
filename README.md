Automated Messaging Script

This Python script uses the pyautogui library to automate the process of sending messages. It randomly selects from a list of phrases and types out a message, "I love you" followed by one of the selected phrases, then sends it by pressing 'Enter'. The script repeats this process 25 times, with a half-second delay between each message to simulate natural typing speed.

Features:
Random Message Selection: Chooses a random phrase from a predefined list to append to the message.
Automated Typing: Types out the generated message automatically.
Sending Messages: Simulates pressing the 'Enter' key to send the message.
Adjustable Frequency: Configurable delay between messages to control typing speed.
Requirements:
pyautogui library for automating keyboard inputs.
Basic understanding of Python programming.
Usage:
Install the pyautogui library using pip install pyautogui.
Run the script in an environment where it can type messages (e.g., a chat application or text field).
Ensure the script window is active and focused when running.
Note: Use this script responsibly to avoid spamming or violating any platform's terms of service.
